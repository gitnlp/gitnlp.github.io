        <p>Dr. Furu Wei is a Partner Research Manager (首席研究员/全球合伙人) at Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China, where he is leading the Natural Language Processing group and overseeing the team's research on Foundation Models (across tasks, languages and modalities), NLP, MT, Speech and Multimodal AI. He got his B.Sc and Ph.D from Department of Computer Science of Wuhan University in 2004 and 2009, respectively. He was a Staff Researcher at IBM Research - China (IBM CRL) from Jul. 2009 to Nov. 2010, and a Research Assistant at Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University from Jan. 2007 to Jun. 2009.
</p>
        
        <br>

    <p>Furu published over 200 research papers in prestigious conferences and journals in natural language processing and artificial intelligence, including ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, COLING, Computational Linguistics, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, SIGIR, KDD, AAAI, IJCAI, etc. According to <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G-V1VpwAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"><font color="blue">Google Scholar</font></a>, his H-index is 70 with more than 20,000 citations (as of 2022). As a co-author, Furu received the Best Paper Runners Up award at AAAI 2021, and the Best Student Paper award at KDD 2018. Furu served as a Senior Area Chair in ACL 2021, an Area Chair in EMNLP 2015, NAACL-HIT 2016, EMNLP 2019, and NeurIPS 2021. He has more than 20 patents filed or granted. The research from Furu and his team has been widely used in Microsoft products, including Office (Word, PowerPoint, Outlook and Microsoft Designer), Bing, Microsoft Ads, Azure (Cognitive Services), Dynamics, Windows, LinkedIn, etc. </p>
    
        <br>
        
    <p>In addition to the research efforts to push the state-of-the-art in specific tasks and areas like NLP, MT, Speech and Multimodal AI, Furu and his team has been working on a mission-focused research with the long-term vision to advance artificial general (adaptable & generalizable) intelligence, focusing on the <i>generality</i>, <i>generalizability</i>, and <i>adaptability</i> of AI. Specifically, the team's research on Foundation Models has been pushing large-scale AI and The Big <b>Convergence</b> of large-scale pre-training across tasks, languages, and modalities, including <font color="blue">UniLM</font>(-2) for language model pre-training; InfoXLM, <font color="blue">XLM-E</font> for multilingual pre-training; <font color="blue">BEiT</font>(-2) for vision pre-training; WavLM, SpeechLM for speech pre-training; <font color="blue">BEiT-3</font> for multimodal pre-training; <font color="blue">Layout(X)LM(-2/3)</font> as the first multimodal document foundation model; <font color="blue">MetaLM</font> as the general-purpose foundation model; <font color="blue">Multiway Transformers</font> for multimodal modeling and <font color="blue">Magneto</font> (Foundation Transformers) for true general-purpose modeling, to name a few.
        Also, the research has been pushing fundamental AI, such as the <font color="blue">TorchScale</font> initiative which focuses on fundamental research to improve modeling generality and capability as well as training stability and efficiency for <b>Transformers at any scale</b>, including <font color="blue">DeepNet</font>, <font color="blue">Magneto</font> (Foundation Transformers), and X-MoE. 
        We also work on fundamental research and technology for building AI products w/ foundation models. For example, we develop effective and efficient approaches to deploying large AI models in practice, including <font color="blue">MiniLM</font>(-2), <font color="blue">xTune</font>, EdgeFormer, and <font color="blue">Aggressive Decoding</font>, as well as the <font color="blue">LMOps</font> initiative which specifically focuses on general technology for enabling AI capabilities w/ LLMs and Generative AI models. In addition to the research achievements, these models are significant parts of Microsoft's own family of large AI (foundation) models powering language and multimodal tasks and scenarios across products in Microsoft. Moreover, our research tops public benchmarks and leaderboards across language (GLUE, XTREME), vision (ADE20k, COCO), speech (SUPERB), and multimodal (NLVR2, VQAv2) tasks, and hugely contributes to the open source community through GitHub and Hugging Face.</p>
